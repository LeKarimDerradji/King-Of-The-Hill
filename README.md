# King-Of-The-Hill
 
 The King Of The Hill is usually a game that is played in the world of Hacking. 
 
 To see who is better at hacking a given system, you set one up with some flaws in it, intentionnaly. 
 
 Then, many hackers have to access the system, the first to do it, gain access to the system and now have to secure it from the inside. 
 
 He therefore becomes the King Of The Hill, until another hacker breaks into his self-proclaimed kingdom and dethrone him/her.
 
 On a Blockchain, the game was slightly different, a smart contract was deployed, and the one who placed the highest bid, became the King.
 The one that placed a bid higher than the last one, now have the crown on his head, before a richer person dared to place a bid. 
 
 
 There's many thing that you can learn there, first, how to give access to who and why.
